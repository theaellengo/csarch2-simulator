# Decimal-64 Simulator

## IEEE-754 Decimal-64 floating point converter (including all special cases)

• Input: Decimal and base-10 (i.e., 127.0x105) – should handle more than 7 digits properlyand NaN

• Output: binary output with space as well as its hexadecimal equivalent (with option to
paste result in notepad)

Note: No rounding/truncation were manually performed for inputs larger than 16 digits. Such operations seem to be
ignored, the digits are automatically rounded inconsistently....
